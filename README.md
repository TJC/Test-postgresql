# Test::PostgreSQL

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/TJC/Test-postgresql/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/TJC/Test-postgresql/tree/master)

Test::PostgreSQL helps you run unit tests that require a PostgreSQL database,
by starting one up for you, and automatically cleaning it up at the end of
the test.

It is designed to allow multiple tests to run in parallel, with multiple
postgresql instances, without conflict.
